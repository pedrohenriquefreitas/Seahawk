    <h1>Russell Wilson</h1>
   		<p>For many Seattle Seahawks fans, Russell Wilson has been the breath of life back into the struggling NFL franchise. Before Wilson, the Seahawks faced plateauing ticket sales, a decrease in home game attendance and a dip in the overall franchise value.
Wilson was drafted by the Seattle Seahawks as the 75th pick in the 2012 NFL Draft. (Coleman, 2012) Since the beginning of his career with the Seahawks, Wilson has brought back to life the 12th man fans that had started to dwindle. After leading the Seahawks to their first ever franchise Super Bowl win in 2012, Seahawks fans followed suit and broke the Guinness World Record for loudest sport stadium scream the following season on September 15th, 2013 (Janela, 2013), though they have since been dethroned of this title.
This website is dedicated the all the 12th men and women who want to get to know the man behind the rebirth of the 12th man.</p>
